          <div class="memory-date">Late 2013: A Call to All Heroes</div>
          <div class="memory-text">In one fateful semester in 2013, I studied Mobile Application Development and built my very first Android app. It was called 'A Call to All Heroes' and was physical fitness routine, veiled, adorned in a Fantasy fiction theme.</br></br>The idea was that, despite perhaps stereotype and widely held belief, fans of fantasy fiction and Roleplaying Games (RPGs) possessed the ideal attributes for pursuing physical development. They could consistently and repetitively follow routine, they were motivated through visible, tangible progress. It seemed that the world of physical fitness only needed to be translated to them in a common language</br></br>Enter <b>A Call to All Heroes!</b> Users would choose a class, which would provide them with a routine directed to certain physical attributes; They might choose a Barbarian to develop strength (anaerobic), or a Rogue to develop stamina (aerobic). Routines were presented and unlocked in zones to be travesed by the user. A new zone would yeild greater rewards, but more challenging routines. I wanted to account for users of all types - each zone would have routines for user's with access to a gym, a pair of dumbbells, or nothing but their bare hands!</br></br>The implementation is a definitely a little rough around the edges - that sure as hell ain't Google standard Android design practices. But the concept for the project is there, and shall be revisted in the future!</div>

          <div class="memory-text">Ever wondered what happened what might happen if you give your students complete freedom to create an Internet of Things system over the course of a semester? In the case of my team, we stuck Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to our pets and monitored their movement around the house.</br></br>Pets would move around our home fitted with small estimote beacons fitted to their collars, beacons which would be continously emitting a BLE signal. This signal would be picked up by RaspberryPi receivers strategically placed around our house. The receivers would forward any detected signals to a cloud-based server. Using an app on an Android device, the user could connect to this server and locate their pet based on where it was last detected</div>

          <div class="memory-text">What a great beast you see before you in the image to the left. An intimidating, majestic mass of electronics. Aye, she's a beauty. The combined effort of roughly 15 ICT Engineering students in a single semester ICT Design, run by Zenon Chaczko.</br></br>But it's on the inside that counts right? It is very much the case for this system, this machine.It was coined the name of the 'Integrated Home Energy Management System' or IHEMS. It is a system that encompasses the combined programmatic interfacing of energy production (solar panels), energy storage (batteries) and home automation technologies.</br></br>My part in this project was taking care of the home automation side of the show. My team crafted our own Z-Wave  controller (Z-Wave being a home automation communications protocol). Our controller was a Raspberry Pi fitted with a Z-Wave communications module, called the "RaZberry". We would send RESTful commands to the the Pi, which would then relay them through the RaZberry. Our part of the system meant that we could remotely operate electrical appliances and monitor their energy consumption.</div>

          <div class="memory-text">Over the course of 2015, my final year studying at UTS, I pursued an capstone project investigating whether video games might be an effective medium to communicate concepts surrounding human interaction and perceiving emotion.</br></br>Part of my project involved creating my own proof of concept, for which I chose to do by creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest">quest</a> within the popular video game, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</br></br>The project proved to be an ambitious one, it was revealed that it would involve more than just computer science, but also needing a great deal of thought and effort within the realms of psychology and creative writing.</div>
