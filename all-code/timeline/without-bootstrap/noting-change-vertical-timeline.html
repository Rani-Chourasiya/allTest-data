                        homelands to Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma) in the Western United States became known
                        as The Trail of Tears. The phrase originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw
                        Nation in 1831. Many Native Americans suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en
                        route to their destinations, and many died, including 4,000 of the 15,000 relocated Cherokee. By
                        1837, 46,000 Native Americans from these southeastern nations had been removed from their
                        homelands thereby opening 25 million acres for settlement by European Americans.</p>

                        they were slaves—were not protected by the Constitution and could never be citizens of the
                        United States. It also held that the United States Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery
                        in federal territories. The Court also ruled that because slaves were not citizens, they could
                        not sue in court. Lastly, the Court ruled that slaves—as chattel or private property—could not
                        be taken away from their owners without due process.</p>

                    <p class="about">America’s bloodiest clash, the sectional conflct of the Civil War (1861-65) is the
                        central event in America's historical consciousness. While the Revolution of 1776-1783 created
                        the United States, the Civil War determined what kind of nation it would be. The war resolved
                        two fundamental questions left unresolved by the revolution: whether the United States was to be
                        a dissolvable confederation of sovereign states or an indivisible nation with a sovereign
                        national government; and whether this nation, born of a declaration that all men were created
                        with an equal right to liberty, would continue to exist as the largest slaveholding country in
                        the world. Northern victory in the war preserved the United States as one nation and ended the
                        institution of slavery that had divided the country from its beginning.</p>
                    <p class="about">
                        On December 24, 1865, Nathan Bedford Forrest, along with 5 Confederate veterans, founded the KKK
                        “in order to protect white rights,” as its members claimed. They banded together to beat,
                        torture and lynch black people for what was perceived as the slightest infraction of the law.

                    <p class="about">Jim Crow was not a person, yet affected the lives of millions of people. Named
                        after a popular 19th-century minstrel song that stereotyped African Americans, "Jim Crow" came
                        to personify the system of government-sanctioned racial oppression and segregation in the United
                        States between 1877 and the mid-1960s. Jim Crow was more than a series of rigid anti-black laws.
                        It was a way of life. Under Jim Crow, African Americans were relegated to the status of second
                        class citizens. Jim Crow represented the legitimization of anti-black racism.</p>

                    <h2 class="designation">Internment Camps</h2>
                    <p class="about">The US government came to the conclusion that interning Japanese-American citizens
                        was the best of a number of bad options. Roughly a hundred thousand Japanese-Americans ended up
                        in camps. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066 on February 19,
                        uprooting Japanese Americans on the west coast to be sent to Internment camps. The order led to
                        the internment of Japanese Americans or AJAs (Americans of Japanese Ancestry) in which some
                        120,000 ethnic Japanese people were held in internment camps for the duration of the war. Of the
                        Japanese interned, 62% were Nisei (American-born, second-generation Japanese American and
                        therefore American citizens) or Sansei (third-generation Japanese American, also American
                        citizens) and the rest were Issei (Japanese immigrants and resident aliens, first-generation
                        Japanese American).</p>

                    <h2 class="designation">Murdered: Loving Thy Neighbor</h2>
                    <p class="about"> On "Bloody Sunday," March 7, 1965, some 600 civil rights marchers headed east out
                        of Selma on U.S. Route 80 on their way to Montgomery in effort to register African-American
                        voters in Selma. They got only as far as the Edmund Pettus Bridge six blocks away, where state
                        and local lawmen attacked them with billy clubs and tear gas and drove them back into Selma. On
                        March 9, 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. had again attempted to march with more than 1,500 other
                        civil rights advocates. King decided to return Selma, however, after encountering the state
                        police along the way. That night in Selma, a white minister named James Reeb, whom had traveled
                        to Alabama to join the march, was beaten to death by a group of segregationists.</p>
                    <p class="about">Viola Gregg Liuzzo also traveled to Alabama to join and support the movement. On
                        the night of her arrival, Liuzzo was driving another civil rights worker with the SCLC, an
                        African-American teenager named Leroy Moton, back to Selma on Highway 80, when another car
                        pulled alongside her vehicle. One of the passengers in the neighboring car shot at Liuzzo,
                        striking her in the face and killing her. The car ended up in a ditch, and Moton survived the
                        attack by pretending to be dead. Liuzzo was murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan. She was the
                        only known white female killed during the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

                    <p class="about">
                        According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there are about 784 known hate groups that are
                        active and operating across the United States. Those groups include neo-Nazis, white extremists,
                        neo-Confederates, racist skinheads and white nationalists and others. More than 250,000
                        Americans over the age of 12 are victimized every year by hate crimes. According to a Bureau of
                        Justice Statistics report about one in three hate crimes are ever reported to law enforcement
                        officials.

                    <p class="about">
                        The events that inspire racial discrimination and hatred in this country are widely rejected and
                        railed against by many. Yet it would seem that those in the majority still hold onto the
                        misconceptions and stereotypes the media portrays to condemn minorities of all backgrounds based
                        on the actions of a few. African Americans are still viewed as dangerous despite facts and
                        evidence to the contrary, Arab Americans are still seen as potential terrorists by many despite
                        having been in America for half a century, Latino Americans will still have the misconception of
                        illegal immigrants despite their history with America, and Asian Americans will still be Asian
                        faces among the Americans, remaining the outsiders of the American equation. On the flip side,
                        by many minorities, whites are presumed racist until proven otherwise. It’s time to acknowledge
                        that racism is the biggest elephant in the room in American culture. The issue is so deeply
                        ingrained in our society that we willingly and subconsciously draw lines on the ground between
                        neighborhoods and place gates around our communities that separate those that are like us from
                        those that are not.
